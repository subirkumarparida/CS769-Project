# CS769-Project

Note1: The contextual bandit runs with the "Bibtex" dataset
Note2: The pre-processing code of the Bibtex dataset is not of our own, and we have used it as is from the library
Note3: The Bootstrapped UCB is not verified on larger distributions. 
The upper confidence bound is implemented using the values of \alpha & \beta, which is a bit different from the actual paper, but seems to work well in this case
